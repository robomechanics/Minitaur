These steps will set up your computer to compile and upload code onto the Minitaur.

1. Download Arduino 1.6.1 for your OS from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous - make sure the arduino folder (the one that has arduino-1.6.1 in it, not the one called "Arduino" which is mostly empty and we won't use) is in your Documents folder.

2. Make sure you have some sort of Git client (e.g. GitHub Desktop, SourceTree). If you don't, download SourceTree here - https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/. You don't need an Atlassian account or to import any repositories, so skip any setup related to that.

3. Clone the Koduino repository (https://github.com/avikde/koduino.git) into the hardware folder within arduino so that Documents/arduino-1.6.1-windows/arduino-1.6.1/hardware/koduino is a valid path (or the equivalent on a Mac). This repository allows the arduino IDE to communicate with the specific microcontroller aboard the Minitaur

4. Clone the Minitaur repository (https://github.com/robomechanics/Minitaur.git) into your Documents folder. This folder contains the Minitaur specific code, such as the behaviors, communication, and motor controller libraries.

5. Open Minitaur/minitaur_gaits_pp/minitaur_gaits_pp.ino, (it should open within Arduino). Set the following preferences in Arduino:
	File->Preferences-> Make sure "Sketchbook location" is the path to Documents/Minitaur
	File->Preferences-> check  "Display line numbers" (optional, but you'll want it)
	Tools->Board->F303V(...)
	Tools->CPU Speed->72MHz
	Tools->Bootloader->stm32ld
Restart Arduino, then reopen minitaur_gaits_pp.ino. Click the check mark in the upper left labelled "Verify". This should compile the code. Make sure it compiles before moving on.

6. Plug in the minitaur via USB. Make sure Tools->Port has a new option when you plug the minitaur in, and select that option. Click the -> in the upper left corner labelled "Upload". Follow the instructions below depending on what it says after it compiles
	1) "Programming flash" followed by a progress bar - Hooray, you're done!
	2) Something about unable to connect to COM1 (or another number) - either you don't have the right port selected, or your computer can't detect something is plugged in for some reason.
	3) "Unable to connect to bootloader" - This is the most likely response, and happend because there are issues with the stm32ld loader. If you get this, do the following
		a. In Arduino, select Tools->bootloader->stm32loader
		b. Make sure you have both python2.7 and pip installed (if you have neither, follow the instructions 1-7 under "Using Python" at http://avikde.me/koduino/html/class_open_log.html).
		c. In the command line, enter: pip install pyserial progressbar
		d. Try uploading again

Common Errors
If Tools->Port is greyed out, make sure Tools->Board is set to F303V...
When compiling:
	- If "AbstractMotor.h" isn't found, make sure your sketchbook location is set to .../Documents/Minitaur
	- If "nvic.h" is not found, make sure Tools->Board is set to F303V...

When uploading:
	- If you get a "unable to connect to bootloader" error, follow 6.3 above
	- If you get some error that says something about COM1 or any other number, try restarting Arduino and making sure that Tools->Port has a new option when you plug in the minitaur
